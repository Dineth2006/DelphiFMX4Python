# DelphiFMX4Python
Delphi's FireMonkey framework as a Python module for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Android GUI development.

<b>Python installation requirements:</b>

The delphifmx library is provided by the [Python4Delphi library](https://github.com/pyscripter/python4delphi) as a standard Python module.
<br>It uses the Python interpreter, requiring Python to be compiled with the "--enable-shared" flag.
<br>Make sure you've set the "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" and "PATH" environment variables and that Python loads the same libpython.so used by delphifmx.
<br>Check out the [scripts directory](scripts) for further instructions in how to install Python and delphifmx library or for an automated installation process.
